**Hello, this is Poojitha Pakeeru!**

**Question 3. Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its
URL and describe its potential applications and values.**
>URL: [UNICEF Dataset](https://data.unicef.org/)
>
>UNICEF datasets is an open-source platform that combines data from both public and private sectors and generates awareness based on algorithms. UNICEF is publishing datasets, interactive dashboards and tables on various aspects like education, nutrition, breastfeeding, stillbirth and displacement of children etc around the world. UNICEF datasets can generate critical insights into the healthcare needs of vulnerable pregnant women and newborn babies. This data is used by local communities and governments to take immediate action and get more funding in the areas that children are more affected.
>
>Magic Box is a platform that UNICEF is investing in to integrate the contributions of private sector companies like Google, IBM and Red Hat who are sharing their data for public good. By tapping into the private sector data is how UNICEF is expanding itself and making more informed decisions. These insights help the organization to respond to disasters, epidemics and any other challenges wisely.
>
>UNICEF is also running a Responsible Data for Children Initiative for making sure that we use the data generated in the best interest of the children themselves. They are partnering with academia as well as cutting-edge data scientists from all over the world to come up with the best solutions possible.
>
>Key Applications of these datasets are:
>
>•	School connectivity for children
>
>•	Using mobility data to track disease spread during Epidemics.
>
>•	Evaluating Natural Disasters Impact

**Question 4. Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute
information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.**

>URL: [Introduction to Metadata](https://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/)
>
>Book Name: Introduction to Metadata
>
>Author: Murtha Baca
>
>Institution: The Getty Research Institute Publications Program
>
>Introduction to Metadata is a revised edition which was first published in the year 1998. This book provides us with basics of metadata, its types, characteristics and roles. The book talks about the emergence of phenomena such as linked open data in the past few years and its significance in the Semantic Web. Metadata and its relation with the web resources, usage of Metadata by search engines is discussed in the book. The book highlights the difference between visible web and hidden web.
>
>What I liked about the book is that, just like the Metadata, the book is also a collaborative effort from many professionals which is why we can see different perspectives in different chapters.
